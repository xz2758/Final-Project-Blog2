    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      This project is a commercial website for my restaurnat which is located in NYC.
      This is a Chinese restaurant eating Yuannan rice noodle.
      This restaurant is owned by me and my husband. It is a every good chance to use what I learned
      from this course to make a website for this restaurant. I was trying to make the website looks as professional as possible.
      If it is pretty good, then I can actuaclly use it. Of course this website is for restaurant's customers to view our store.
      They also can order our food by three ordering platform in NYC.

    <h3>Design Inspiration:</h3>
    <p>
      At the beginning of starting this website, I listed what pages I want to include in this website. I also searched many other
      restaurant webstie what they usually contains in their pages. I decided to have six pages, they are: The starting page, home, about, menu, order and contact.
      I was going over mostly stuff from W3school website. They have many templates and a page called "How to". However, I didn't use any template exactly.
      They are just one of my consideration for what my website will look like.  https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp
      The starting page I added a javascript of snowing which refers to Christmas is coming. I searched the code from codepen webiste.
      For future usage, I can change the javascript on this page to falling leaves for autum, rainning for spring, etc.
      It can be changed in order to anything happen. On the menu page, all the pictures on the website is taking by myself and photoshoped by myself.
      I used random words lorem for details. The picture on About page I took it also. I didn't come up very precisely abstract for the restaurant.
      So I used lorem agian. We don't do our own delivery service, but we use postmates, grubhub and chowbus. So I includes all the links for each platform.
      On the Contact page, I herf the address to a map link. customers can send message to me by using email. I added @media in each page, when the window shrink,
      contents will shrink. I didn't use many javascript in my website, only the starting page. Every page has the menu bar that user can go any page.
      I didn't have a very good plan of what I am going to do for each page. I was changing and editing through all the time.
      Once I found something that I really wanted to use, it may affect other rangement, I needed to rerange everything agian.
